title : System Design on AWS - Book with O'Reilly Media
---

I've spent a lot of time working with AWS cloud and building systems. Building systems on AWS and in-general taught me various things and helped in figuring out what's best for the specific use case. The book ["System Design on AWS"](https://oreillymedia.pxf.io/c/5915786/2322629/15173) co-authored with Jayanth Kumar extends our learnings in the written format to design and launch large scale systems.

The book finds a fine balance for diving deep into each concept and then leveraging these concepts to build systems. The book is divided into three parts - 
1. System Design Basics 
2. Diving Deep into AWS Services
3. System Design Use Cases

The first part of this book will give you a solid foundation in system design, offering insights into the fundamental principles that underpin all types of software systems, ranging from trade-offs to the criteria for picking the right tools and technologies and thus, the right architecture patterns.

Part II of this book covers the common AWS network, storage, compute, orchestration, big data and analytics, and machine learning (ML) services. We’ll explore the inherent designs and benefits of these managed services. This part also provides guidance for how these services need to be structured in a well-architected framework to build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for a variety of applications and workloads.

Part III of this book covers some common system design use cases and examples, which we will work through together to build and scale on top of AWS cloud computing services. For all the use cases, we’ll start with figuring out the system requirements, then move to a deep dive into system components, and finally close the chapter with a deployment view on AWS with Day 0 architecture (minimum viable product for a startup with, say, one thousand customers) and Day N architecture (scaling to millions of customers). Along the way, we’ll discuss the bottlenecks that might occur in design, best practices for designing large-scale systems, and comparisons of similar AWS services.

I wish you the very best for your success in building systems :)
