title: Coding my personal website
---

It is total fun doing html+css coding, though I didn't coded it completely, I used jekyll site, but all the customizations
are done by me :smiley:

I learnt many things during this process, like arranging multiple images side by side and create a hovering effect over them
also embedding the css code with html.

I also enabled discus comments sections below my posts, so you can comment upon my posts and give suggestions over any further improvements in the website, the way it is designed.

However, the html+css coding is not as adventrous as my favourite languages c++ and erlang :blush:

Have a great day.
